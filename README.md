# encontro

Description: An interactive, agenda-focused meeting app which allows users to join meetings, chat, take notes, raise silent concerns, etc. The app stores the agenda and notes for users to access at a later date. 

Purpose: Too often are meetings ineffective because the items discussed are quickly discarded from the minds of the attendees. This app makes the meeting more memorable by promoting participation, and allows a user to access the notes at any time.
